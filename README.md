# CPU Architecture Simulator

### 3D Interactive Comparison of RISC, CISC, and EPIC Architectures

This project visualizes how **RISC**, **CISC**, and **EPIC (Itanium)** architectures handle instruction execution cycles.  
It is built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Plotly.js** for rich, interactive 3D visualization.

Features
- **Instruction Library** â€“ Add memory, arithmetic, or control operations dynamically.
- **Architecture Comparison** â€“ Visualizes RISC, CISC, and EPIC execution cycles in 3D.
- **Plotly Visualization** â€“ Real-time updates for each added instruction.
- **Reset & Modify** â€“ Instantly reset or modify instruction sets.
- **Compact UI** â€“ Built with Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and clarity.

Architecture Logic

| Architecture | Cycle Model | Key Trait |
|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **RISC** | 1 cycle per instruction | Simple, predictable, low power |
| **CISC** | 2â€“4 cycles per instruction | Complex, multi-cycle ops |
| **EPIC** | Bundled (3 per cycle) | Parallel execution, compiler-driven |
